# Jesspresso
A repository that collects all of the data for automating Philips coffee machines.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is two-fold. Firstly, to create a platform for adding physical buttons to the machines for use by blind, DeafBlind, and low vision users. Second, is to create an API for controlling the machines from an app or automation software.

## Status
This is a work in-progress. Currently, we are in the research gathering stages and are pulling together all that is known about automating these coffee machines.

## Supported Appliances
You can find a [list of supported appliances here](./Appliances/Phillips/EP/README.md)
